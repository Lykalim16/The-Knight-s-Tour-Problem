# The-Knight-s-Tour-Problem

CMSC 162 - Artificial Intelligence

Authors: LIM, Lyka Raquel C. and Oabel, Cliff

Presented to Mr. Lee Javellana

Objective: To experiment with blind and heuristic search algorithms on the Knight’s tour problem.

Blind Search
  The Authors created a program that implements a blind search of the Knight’s Tour using either a depth-first or breadth-first search where starting point is on d4. Expected output is a  chessboard showing the starting position and the solution saved as .txt files.
Warnsdorf’s Rule
  The Authors created a program that implements an informed search of the Knight’s Tour using Warnsdorf’s rule where starting point is on d4. Expected output is a chessboard showing the starting position and the solution saved as .txt files.

The authors used JAVA as its programming language where codes are saved as blindSearch.java for Blind Search and warnsdorf.java for Warndorf's Rule. Solutions for both search algorithms are saved as BlindSearch_OutputText.txt and Warsdorfs_OutputText.txt. Documentation is saved as Lim_Oabel_CMSC162_MP01.pdf
